# Metadata Annotation Service
A metadata annotation service to support standardised metadata 
annotation. The prototypical service will support researchers and data holders 
with the FAIRification of already existing and new data collections.

* Yarn
* Node

## General info
The web application allows users to upload data collection instruments in the convenient and common Microsoft Excel-Spreadsheet format. The metadata annotation is performed in the web browser. The user is provided with search results of the instrument's data items from the terminology service and can perform a manual text search. The initial search suggestion for each data item is generated by string matching and simple natural language processing like tokenization and stemming. The user can select an ontology for annotation from all ontologies included in the terminology service. Detailed information about a concept is displayed in the semantic information widget that is provided by the terminology service. The annotated instrument can then be downloaded comprising the data items and corresponding annotations as international resource identifier (IRI), a unique and machine-readable identifier that leads to the metadata of the data item.

## Setup

### Development
Start the backend/install virtual environment:
```
$ cd backend
$ python3 -m venv venv 
$ source ./venv/bin/activate
$ pip3 install -r ./requirements.txt 
$ export FLASK_APP=restapi 
$ export FLASK_ENV=development
$ flask run
```
Start the frontend:
```
$ cd frontend
$ yarn install
$ yarn start
```

### Production

Create production build for all services:  
Uncomment `build: ./frontend` and `build: ./backend` in `docker-compose.yaml`

```
$ docker-compose --env-file dev.env build
$ docker-compose --env-file dev.env up
```

To stop a production build of all services:
` docker-compose --env-file dev.env down`
